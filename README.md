inlineSVG
=========

Takes an inline `<img>` with an SVG as it's source and swaps it for an inline `<svg>` so you can manipulate the style of it with CSS/JS etc.

Based on this [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11978995/how-to-change-color-of-svg-image-using-css-jquery-svg-image-replacement) post's answer by [Drew Baker](http://stackoverflow.com/users/503546/drew-baker) with some enhancements.
